Apologies for the recent lack of updates: some changes to YouTube broke my
system for updating playlists in bulk, then life got in the way. I'm back with a
few updates:

1. New playlist for "Dimension 20: Burrow's End":
   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLObfuAmZm9pCXX8ABGmvnd9oWo3JXrCUS.
2. New playlist for "Dimension 20: Shriek Week":
   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLObfuAmZm9pDLiMGbBWJtqXV9Z7o6TrxY.
   Oops! I made a typo in the word "Shriek" which caused this playlist to never
   get uploaded properly.
3. New playlist for "Game Changer":
   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLObfuAmZm9pAgvtZ1cEHbEHKqp9D3ePHS.
4. New playlist for "Um, Actually":
   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLObfuAmZm9pBtHSq5HewgAKihMK6kaeJS. If
   some of the episode numbers seem to be mixed-up, it's because this uses the
   episode order from Dropout.tv, while on YouTube some of the early seasons
   were released with different episode or no number at all. This also includes
   the pre-Dropout episodes of Um, Actually at the beginning like a Season 0.
   Note that the free episodes often include mid-roll advertisements that the
   paid ones would not, but we still prefer the free episodes for compatibility
   with YouTube Premium's background and offline playback capabilities (and
   availability, of course).
5. New playlist for "Make Some Noise":
   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLObfuAmZm9pDfm8v_2TRx_GSpV43ABXsM.
   This includes the four pre-spin-off Game Changer episodes of "Make Some
   Noise" at the beginning like a season 0.
6. New playlist for "Breaking News / No Laugh Newsroom":
   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLObfuAmZm9pBIEdqpWKGZXaUroUOThmmJ.
   This uses the episode order from Dropout.tv, which is mostly the same but
   there are a handful of episodes have different numbers or no numbers on
   YouTube.
7. New playlist for "Play It By Ear":
   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLObfuAmZm9pCsCC1Vkjb6hV6Vvew3z-Z_.
   This includes the pre-spin-off Game Changer episode "The Official Cast
   Recording" at the beginning like a season 0.
8. New playlist for "Dirty Laundry":
   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLObfuAmZm9pDfejgejY4h6r06blOLedPl.
   This includes the pre-spin-off Game Changer episode "Never Have I Ever" at
   the beginning like a season 0.
9. New playlist for "Adventuring Academy":
   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLObfuAmZm9pDMHtb0drlb8b6hC3FG_A5r. The
   four "Office Hours" episodes are included after Season 1.
10. Updated "Fantasy High: Sophomore Year / Chapter 2" to use the newly-released
    free versions of every episode. Previously, only the first 5 episodes were
    free, but as promotion for the new season they also released the rest of the
    season as well!
11. All current episodes of "Game Changer: Season 6" and "Fantasy High: Junior
    Year / Chapter 3" have been added, and I'll try to keep things updated going
    forward.
12. Updated playlist name format to specify the number of seasons (for
    multi-season playlists), or the number of episodes and extras.

I can't promise same-day updates like I was trying to do in the past, but I'll
try to keep things updated at least weekly.
