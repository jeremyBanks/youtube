Hello! My apologies for the recent lack of updates: some changes to YouTube
broke my system for updating playlists in bulk, then life got in the way, but
I'm back on top of things with a few updates:

1. New playlist for "Game Changer":
   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLObfuAmZm9pAgvtZ1cEHbEHKqp9D3ePHS.
   This has every episode of "Game Changer" as well as the behind-the-scenes
   episodes, with free videos used where possible, like I do for the "Dimension
   20" playlists.
2. Updated "Fantasy High: Sophomore Year / Chapter 2" to use the newly-released
   free versions of every episode. Previously, only the first 5 episodes were
   free, but as promotion for the new season they also released the rest of the
   season as well!
3. New playlist for "Dimension 20: Burrow's End":
   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLObfuAmZm9pCXX8ABGmvnd9oWo3JXrCUS.
4. New playlist for "Dimension 20: Shriek Week":
   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLObfuAmZm9pDLiMGbBWJtqXV9Z7o6TrxY.
   Oops. I made a typo in the word "Shriek" which caused this playlist to never
   get uploaded properly, and didn't notice until now. My bad!
5. All current episodes of "Game Changer: Season 6" and "Fantasy High: Junior
   Year / Chapter 3" have been added, and I'll try to keep things updated going
   forward. I can't promise same-day updates like I was trying to do in the
   past, but my goal is to at least update them weekly.

I would like to have a playlist for "Um, Actually" as well, but it has _so many_
episodes, both paid and free, that cataloguing them all including which free
ones correspond to which paid ones is a bit too tedious. I may get to it in the
future, or I may not.

I'm unlisting the "Dimension 20 (Free Episodes and Extras)" playlist
(https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLObfuAmZm9pBlmfWjeRYUmsucnZo87ONA)
because it doesn't seem like many people were using it and it's kind-of silly:
it doesn't make sense to include free extra content for paid episodes that the
playlist can't include.
