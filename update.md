Apologies for the recent lack of updates: some changes to YouTube broke my
system for updating playlists in bulk, then life got in the way. I'm back with a
few updates:

1. New playlist for "Dimension 20: Burrow's End":
   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLObfuAmZm9pCXX8ABGmvnd9oWo3JXrCUS.
2. New playlist for "Dimension 20: Shriek Week":
   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLObfuAmZm9pDLiMGbBWJtqXV9Z7o6TrxY.
   Oops! I made a typo in the word "Shriek" which caused this playlist to never
   get uploaded properly.
3. New playlist for "Game Changer":
   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLObfuAmZm9pAgvtZ1cEHbEHKqp9D3ePHS.
4. New playlist for "Um, Actually":
   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLObfuAmZm9pBtHSq5HewgAKihMK6kaeJS.
5. New playlist for "Make Some Noise":
   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLObfuAmZm9pDfm8v_2TRx_GSpV43ABXsM.
6. New playlist for "Play It By Ear":
   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLObfuAmZm9pCsCC1Vkjb6hV6Vvew3z-Z_.
7. Updated "Fantasy High: Sophomore Year / Chapter 2" to use the newly-released
   free versions of every episode. Previously, only the first 5 episodes were
   free, but as promotion for the new season they also released the rest of the
   season as well!
8. All current episodes of "Game Changer: Season 6" and "Fantasy High: Junior
   Year / Chapter 3" have been added, and I'll try to keep things updated going
   forward.

I can't promise same-day updates like I was trying to do in the past, but I'll
try to keep things updated at least weekly.

I might add Breaking News and some other Dropout shows in the future.
